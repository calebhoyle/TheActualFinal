        <center><h3>Design</h3></center>
       <center> <p> After receiving the final project our team had tested multiple different pieces that had been built by groups previous to ours. We noticed the flaws in these designs and quickly realized <br>
        that instead of using the tool of our forebears we instead needed to build our own. At which point we designated certain tasks to different people within the Circuit Breakers in order to get the best possible<br>
         outcome. However when I saw this project my first idea was to come up with a design that would be able to suck in oxygen/air as fast as possible and then generate power at a consistent rate. Coming up with a design <br>
         wasn't even the hard part about it but figuring out how to design it and learning the software that allowed me to make it, leading me into the process of it. </p></center>
       <center><h3>Process</h3></center>
       <center> <p> This was the trickiest part, because we had multiple different tools we could have used to build this windmill but 3D printing was the best option. Our professor showed us the software <br>
        Onshape in a lesson before so all of us in the Circuit Breakers opted to use this in order to help each other out incase one of us became stuck during a design. My design acted as a stream line suction <br>
        for the wind that optimized the power being generated. </p></center>
        <center><h3>Findings</h3></center>
        <center><p>After seeing the other members of the Circuit Breakers designs come the final day for testing I realized one fatal flaw with my final design. I had made the fan larger <br>
            inside the slicer resulting in the connecting hole being too large for the rod that it would spin on. Even with that mistake I was still proud of my design and knowing that enlarging <br>
            the print inside the slicer would change the dimensions is a good thing because I wonâ€™t be making that same mistake in the future. This final project was a lot of fun and an amazing learning <br>
            experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.</p></center>
