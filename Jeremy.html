        <center><h3>Project Overview</h3></center>
       <center> <p> Renewable energy is an everlasting necessity for the world seeing as more and more technology is being developed and as it increases in both quantity and magnitude, more energy is needed to power said technology. <br>
        A VAWT (Vertical Axis Wind Turbine) rotates on a vertical axis and is used to efficiently generate energy in low wind areas whereas a HAWT (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine) rotates on a horizontal axis and is mainly used in dedicated wind farms. <br> </p>
        <h3>Design Process</h3> 
        <p> In a HAWT, the main components would most likely be the coils, along with the magnets and fans alongside it. The coils are wires bundled together in a circular shape and used for a current when affected by a magnetic field created by <br>
        the magnets that surround it in a wind turbine. Voltage is generated when the shaft connected to the magnets is spun fast enough to create an electric current. This speed can be reached when adding fans to the other end of the shaft. <br></p>
        <h3>Testing Procedure  Magnet Data and Analysis</h3> 
        <p>four magnets are fastened on the end of a shaft, when this shaft spins a current is created through the coils under the magnets. Coil data, we used four coils to use as a generator for our turbine <br>
        while recording the resistance of them in the lab. Generator Test Data, after testing with a motor to spin our turbine, we recorded the frequencies and voltage being produced during testing.  <br></p>
        <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3> 
        <p>Although we were able to get voltage, our results were essentially bottlenecked by the distance between the magnets and coils tampering with the exact voltage we should have generated. <br></p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>After testing in the wind tunnel, we were able to see that a blade with a standard spiraling shape that was thick enough to handle some pressure worked the best with our turbine design. We learned that in order to optimally generate renewable energy and wind energy, we would have to take into account the safety precautions and overall stability of our future designs for long-term success and learning. </p>
