        <center><h3>Design and Progress</h3></center>
       <center> <p>I modeled my design after the archimedes spiral which is known to be one of the most efficient turbine blades. <br>
        When first Designing the blade in Onshape, it took about 2 classes to come up with the blade I wanted and to fully render it in the software. <br>
        After I decided the design was ready for the first print I emailed the file to Max and he was able to print the first trial blade at home. <br>
        Laying out this project beforehand in stages was a helpful way to stay on track and make sure we were able to <br>
        collect data in the wind tunnel.  </p></center>
       <center><h3>Trial and error</h3></center>
       <center> <p>When Max brought the blade back into class I realized some mistakes that I had made. The first mistake was <br>
        that there was no set screw hole for the blade to be attached to the shaft through. Another flaw was that <br>
        the balde was smaller and thinner than I hoped. And lastly this first print had the outter blades extruded through <br>
        the middle shaft hole, this made it impossible for it to be put on the base. Through these flaws I designed an upgraded version <br>
        of my blade and corrected them all. I printed my next one on a creator pro 3d printer in the basement of the school.  </p></center>
