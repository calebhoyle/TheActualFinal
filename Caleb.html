           <center> <p>In my first stage of this project it was brainstorming ideas. The prompt was to create a wind turbine design <br> using onshape
       that we would then 3d print and test the power output of in the wind tunnel. After brainstorming <br>for a class I came up with a design that 
I liked and I began designing it in Onshape, which is a free CAD software we used for the entire project. </p> </center>
