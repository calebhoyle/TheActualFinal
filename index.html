       <center> <h3></h3></center>
    <center><p> This website is a collaboration of all four of the group members including Caleb, Max, Aidan, and Jeremy.<br>
    For our project we were tasked with designing our own wind turbine blades and testing the power output in a wind tunnel. <br>
  Each of the links below will direct you to each one of our individual designs, our trial and errors, and the progress of the project. <br>
Also attached is our ethics project as well as our data that we collected from the wind tunnel test.</p> </center>
