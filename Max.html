        <center><h3>Weekly Shift Report: Lab Experiments and Notes</h3></center>
       <center> <p> 30 Oct: Conducted, developed, and designed the 3D printing model for the base pillar of the turbine.<br>
        6 Nov: Conducted, developed, and designed the 3D printing model for the turbine blades.<br>
        13 Nov: Addressed issues with the design; opted for a wooden structure for the base instead of 3D printing due to better durability.<br>
        20 Nov: All components were ready for assembly. The final step involves acquiring the coils and testing the current flow through the circuit.<br>
        4 Dec: The turbine was successfully assembled, and the circuit was tested, yielding satisfactory results.<br>
        11 Dec: Tested the blade design and received good voltage readings. However, the distance from the coil to the magnet may be too far and may require readjustment.</p></center>
